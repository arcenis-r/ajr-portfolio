I’m an economist turned data scientist with strong interests in the divergence between inferential modeling and predictive modeling. I really enjoy programming in the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) framework in R and enjoy working with [Tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework for modeling.\
\
I hold a B.S. in Applied Economics from [Ithaca College](https://www.ithaca.edu/) and an M.S. in Economics from the [City University of New York - City College](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/).

I enjoy projects that allow me to learn and implement new techniques ranging from different types of regression analysis to more advanced machine learning algorithms. One of the most fun and rewarding personal projects of mine has been to create the `cepumd` package. You can read more about it [here](https://arcenis-r.github.io/ajr-portfolio/posts/20240124-cepumd-intro/cepumd-intro.html). You can also learn a little bit about my other projects [here](/posts.html).\

I built this website using some great, open-source tools including [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/categories/rstudio-ide/), [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). I’m very grateful to all the folks that work on these tools for what they do. I’m also grateful to [Sam Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/) for her [blog](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/) on how to add a blog to a Quarto website.
