I'm an economist turned consultant/data scientist with strong interests in the divergence between inferential modeling and predictive modeling. Over the last few years I've started to really enjoy programming in the Tidyverse style and have even begun to work quite a bit with Tidymodels.\
\
I hold a B.S. in Applied Economics from [Ithaca College](https://www.ithaca.edu) and an M.S. in Economics from the [City University of New York - City College](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/). I enjoy projects that allow me to learn and implement new techniques ranging from different types of regression analysis to more advanced machine learning algorithms.

One of the most fun personal projects of mine has been to create the `cepumd` package. You can read more about it [here](./posts/20240124-cepumd-intro/cepumd-intro.qmd).

I also enjoy tutoring econometrics, data science, R, and statistics on Wyzant. [Check out my profile!](https://is.gd/6xUixC)

I built this website using some great, open-source tools including [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/categories/rstudio-ide/), [GitHub](https://github.com/), and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). I'm very grateful to all the folks that work on these tools for what they do. I'm also grateful to [Sam Csik](https://samanthacsik.github.io/) for her [blog](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/) on how to add a blog to a Quarto website.
