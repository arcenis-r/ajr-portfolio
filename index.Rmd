I'm an economist turned consultant/data scientist with strong interests in the divergence between inferential modeling and predictive modeling. I hold a B.S. in Applied Economics from [Ithaca College](https://www.ithaca.edu) and an M.S. in Economics from the [City University of New York - City College](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/). I enjoy projects that allow me to learn and implement new techniques ranging from different types of regression analysis to more advanced machine learning algorithms.

<h2 style="clear: both;">Data Projects</h2>

### Medicare's Hospital Readmission Rate Reduction Program (HRRP):
In this project I consider what features might influence the readmission ratio of a given hospital and I compare different quality metrics between hospitals in the program and those that are exempt.
<ul>
  <li>[HRRP Analysis Dashboard](
  https://arcenis-r.github.io/ajr-dashboards/hrrp-dashboard.html
  )</li>
  <li>[ANOVA of the relationships between hosptial factors and readmission ratio](hrrp-anova.html)
</ul>

### Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE)
The following two links are R Shiny applications that I developed with CE Public-Use Microdata (PUMD) to help its users better understand some of its limitations and features.
<ul>
  <li>[Interactive CE Visualization Tool](https://osmrbls.shinyapps.io/ce_shiny_app/)</li>
  <li>[Interactive CE Dictionary](https://osmrbls.shinyapps.io/Interactive_CE_Dictionary/)</li>
</ul>

### Exploring Machine Learning
Most recently I have been exploring various machine learning methods. Below is a link to a small project that I completed based on a real-life problem that I faced on a project.
<ul>
  <li>[Opening the ML 'Black Box' with Shapley Values - A Tidy Approach](https://arcenis-r.github.io/ajr-portfolio/tidy-ml-evaluation.html)</li>
</ul>
