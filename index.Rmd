I'm an economist turned consultant/data scientist with strong interests in the divergence between inferential modeling and predictive modeling. Over the last few years I've started to really enjoy programming in the Tidyverse style and have even begun to work quite a bit with Tidymodels.

I hold a B.S. in Applied Economics from [Ithaca College](https://www.ithaca.edu) and an M.S. in Economics from the [City University of New York - City College](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/). I enjoy projects that allow me to learn and implement new techniques ranging from different types of regression analysis to more advanced machine learning algorithms.

One of the most fun personal projects of mine has been to create the `cepumd` package. You can read more about it here: https://arcenis-r.github.io/ajr-portfolio/cepumd.html

<h2 style="clear: both;">Data Projects</h2>

### Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE)
The following three links are and R package and two R Shiny applications that I developed with CE Public-Use Microdata (PUMD) to help its users better understand some of its limitations and features. [cepumd](https://arcenis-r.github.io/ajr-portfolio/cepumd.html) is a package that eases the burden of downloading a variety of files from the CE and performing complex data wrangling tasks towards calculating weighted annual mean expenditure estimates.

  <li>[R Package: cepumd](https://github.com/arcenis-r/cepumd)
  <li>[Interactive CE Visualization Tool](https://osmrbls.shinyapps.io/ce_shiny_app/)</li>
  <li>[Interactive CE Dictionary](https://osmrbls.shinyapps.io/Interactive_CE_Dictionary/)</li>
</ul>

### Exploring Machine Learning
Most recently I have been exploring various machine learning methods. Below is a link to a small project that I completed based on a real-life problem that I faced on a project.
<ul>
  <li>[Opening the ML 'Black Box' with Shapley Values - A Tidy Approach](https://arcenis-r.github.io/ajr-portfolio/tidy-ml-evaluation.html)</li>
  <li>[Topic Modeling with R](https://arcenis-r.github.io/ajr-portfolio/topic-modeling.html)</li>
</ul>

### Medicare's Hospital Readmission Rate Reduction Program (HRRP):
In this project I consider what features might influence the readmission ratio of a given hospital and I compare different quality metrics between hospitals in the program and those that are exempt then display it using `flexdashboard`
<ul>
  <li>[HRRP Analysis Dashboard](
  https://arcenis-r.github.io/ajr-dashboards/hrrp-dashboard.html
  )</li>
  <li>[ANOVA of the relationships between hosptial factors and readmission ratio](hrrp-anova.html)
</ul>
