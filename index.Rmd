I'm an economist with strong interests in statistics and data science with a B.S. in Applied Economics from <a href="https://www.ithaca.edu" target="_blank">Ithaca College</a> and an M.S. in Economics from the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">City University of New York - City College</a>. I enjoy projects that allow me to learn an implement new techniques ranging from different types of regression analysis to more advanced machine learning algorithms.

### Analysis of Medicare's Hospital Readmission Rate Reduction Program (HRRP):
