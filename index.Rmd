I'm an economist with strong interests in statistics and data science. I hold a B.S. in Applied Economics from <a href="https://www.ithaca.edu" target="_blank">Ithaca College</a> and an M.S. in Economics from the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/" target="_blank">City University of New York - City College</a>.

After completing graduate school I took a position as an economist with the U.S. Beaureau of Labor Statistics in the Division of Consumer Expenditure Surveys.
