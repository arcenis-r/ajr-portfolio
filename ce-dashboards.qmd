## Interactive CE Visualization Tool

I built the [Interactive CE Visualization Tool](https://osmrbls.shinyapps.io/ce_shiny_app/) while working as an economist at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Surveys program. The motivation was to help Public-Use Microdata (PUMD) users better understand some of the methods the program employs to generate annual expenditure estimates. The dashboard helps to answer questions about why it's not statistically sound practice to generate mean expenditure estimates for certain cross-sections of the data, for example.

## Interactive CE Dictionary

The purpose of the [Interactive CE Dictionary](https://osmrbls.shinyapps.io/Interactive_CE_Dictionary/) is to help data users interactively search for variables, codes, and other elements of the CE PUMD rather than read through various PDF documents.
