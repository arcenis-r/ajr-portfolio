The word “summary” had a really high TF-IDF because it was the only word (“no” is a stopword and was dropped) in these documents and it likely isn’t used very frequently in other documents. This is one of the benefits of doing this kind of check before going into modeling. Interestingly, though, neither “pain” nor “stress” are in the terms with the top 15 TF-IDF values. I imagine it’s because these words occur in a lot of the documents and, therefore, would not be very useful in distinguishing one project from another. So I’ll drop the two project with no summaries and go into the modeling.\n\njh_tidy &lt;- jh_tidy |&gt;\n  filter(\n    !project_number %in% c(\"1R61HL156248-01\", \"3U24TR001609-04S1\")\n  )"

    "text": "Modeling\nTo be able to perform text mining of any kind, including structural topic modeling, I first need to put my data into a sparse matrix. For this I’ll use the tidytext::cast_sparse() function.\n\njh_sparse &lt;- jh_tidy |&gt; cast_sparse(project_number, word, n)\n\ndim(jh_sparse)\n\n[1]   28 1023\n\n\nI now have a matrix of 28 and 1023 columns. There is now one column for each distinct word in my corpus of data. I’m going to create a structural model with 3 topics (number chosen arbitrarily) just to get an idea of how I might evaluate a model. I’m going to use the stm::stm() function and use the LDA algorithm to generate my model.\n\njh_lda_3 &lt;- jh_sparse |&gt;\n  stm(K = 3, init.type = \"LDA\", seed = 212, verbose = FALSE)\n\nNow I want to see what some of the most frequently occurring words are within each topic. For this I’m going to simply use the tidy method from stm on the model. By default, the tidy method extracts values of “beta” which tells us the probability that a word comes from a given topic.\n\njh_lda_3 |&gt;\n  tidy() |&gt; \n  group_by(topic) |&gt;\n  slice_max(beta, n = 10, with_ties = FALSE) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(reorder_within(term, beta, topic), beta, fill = factor(topic))) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_reordered() +\n  labs(y = \"Beta\", x = NULL) +\n  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = \"free\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word “pain” is in the top 2 most frequently occurring words in each topic and the word “opioid” occurs in the top 10 words of 2 of the topics. It looks like the model’s not doing a great job of separating topics based on this.\nAnother interesting metric to look at is “gamma” which is the probability that a given document is related to a given topic and this is also provided by our model output, which we can access by specifying the matrix = \"gamma\" argument in our tidy() function.\n\njh_lda_3 |&gt;\n  tidy(matrix = \"gamma\") |&gt;\n  mutate(topic = str_c(\"Topic\", topic, sep = \" \") |&gt; factor()) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(document, gamma, fill = topic)) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:nrow(distinct(jh_tidy, project_number))) +\n  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = \"free\", ncol = 1) +\n  labs(x = \"Document\", y = \"Gamma\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like each document except for Document 16 has a high probability of coming from only 1 topic. This is pretty good considering what the beta values showed.\nNext I’ll see if there’s a better number of topics to separate these documents into."

    "text": "Choosing a number of topics\nFirst I’m going to build a set of LDA models with values of K (number of topics) ranging from 2 to 25. I’m also going to create a hold-out dataset to calculate the heldout-likelihood metric later. This is somewhat akin to using a cross-validation holdout set in other machine learning methodologies.\n\njh_tune_models &lt;- tibble(k = 2:24) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    lda_mod = map(\n      k,\n      \\(x) stm(\n        jh_sparse,\n        K = x,\n        init.type = \"LDA\",\n        seed = 212,\n        verbose = FALSE\n      )\n    )\n  )\n\nheldout &lt;- make.heldout(jh_sparse)\n\nNow I’m going to extract the metrics that I want to use to evaluate my model. I’m going to focus on the approach of find the value of K with high held-out likelihood and semantic coherence metrics, but I’m also interested in looking at the residual and exclusivity metrics, so I’ll keep those as well.\n\njh_tune_results &lt;- jh_tune_models |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    exclusivity = map(lda_mod, exclusivity),\n    semantic_coherence = map(\n      lda_mod,\n      semanticCoherence,\n      documents = jh_sparse,\n      M = 10\n    ),\n    eval_heldout = map(lda_mod, eval.heldout, heldout$missing),\n    residual = map(lda_mod, checkResiduals, jh_sparse)\n  )\n\n\njh_tune_results |&gt;\n  transmute(\n    k,\n    Residuals = map_dbl(residual, \"dispersion\"),\n    `Semantic coherence` = map_dbl(semantic_coherence, mean),\n    `Held-out likelihood` = map_dbl(eval_heldout, \"expected.heldout\"),\n    Exclusivity = map_dbl(exclusivity, mean)\n  ) |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(-k, names_to = \"metrics\", values_to = \"value\") |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(k, value, color = metrics)) +\n  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(x = \"Number of Topics\", y = NULL) +\n  facet_wrap(~ metrics, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe highest held-out likelihood score comes from the model with K = 17 and the highest semantic coherence comes from the model with K = 20, so there’s a little bit of a trade-off. In this case I’m going to go with parsimony and choose the model with K = 17. This model also has relatively high exclusivity. Notably, exclusivity and the residual seem to flatten out and semantic coherence increases dramatically at K &gt; 10.\nNow I’m going to look at both the K = 17 and K = 20 models to see whether one is clearly better. I’m going to start by looking at how easily each model would predict each document to belong to a specific topic. For that, I’m going to look at the maximum values of gamma for each document. For comparison I’m going to show the same plot for the approach of maximizing semantic coherence (K = 21).\n\njh_tune_models |&gt; \n  filter(k %in% c(17, 20)) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    max_gammas = map(\n      lda_mod,\n      \\(x) tidy(x, matrix = \"gamma\") |&gt;\n        group_by(document) |&gt;\n        summarise(gamma = max(gamma), .groups = \"drop\")\n    ),\n    k_label = str_c(\"Number of Topics:\", k, sep = \" \") |&gt; fct_reorder(k)\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(-lda_mod) |&gt;\n  unnest(max_gammas) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(document, gamma, fill = factor(k))) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:24) +\n  labs(x = \"Document\", y = \"Maximum Gamma\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ k_label, ncol = 1) +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like both models yield relatively high probabilities that each document corresponds to one specific topic across the board with only documents 23 and 24 having maximum gammas below 0.75, but the model with K = 17 generally performs a bit better.\nFor the purposes of visualization I’ll look at the top 5 words defining the topics for the 17-topic model.\n\njh_tune_models |&gt; \n  filter(k == 17) |&gt;\n  pluck(\"lda_mod\", 1) |&gt;\n  tidy() |&gt;\n  group_by(topic) |&gt;\n  slice_max(beta, n = 5, with_ties = FALSE) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    topic = str_c(\"Topic\", topic, sep = \" \") |&gt;\n      factor(levels = str_c(\"Topic\", 1:17, sep = \" \"))\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(reorder_within(term, beta, topic), beta, fill = factor(topic))) +\n  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_reordered() +\n  labs(y = \"Beta\", x = NULL) +\n  facet_wrap(~ topic, scales = \"free\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe word “pain” appears in the top 5 words of 7 topics; in further analysis I might consider making this a stop word along with words like “study” and “research”. But topic 11 seems to be about joint issues given the prevalence of the words “osteoarthritis” and “knee”; topic 12 seems to be about demographics with words like “american” and “urban” in the top 5 words; and topic 17 seems to be clearly about digestion issues with words like “pain”, “ibs”, and “abdominal” in the top 5 words.\nFinally, I’ll look at the titles grouped by each project’s maximum gamma value. You be the judge.\n\njh_tune_models |&gt; \n  filter(k == 17) |&gt;\n  pluck(\"lda_mod\", 1) |&gt;\n  tidy(matrix = \"gamma\") |&gt;\n  nest(data = -document) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    data = map(data,\\(x) slice_max(x, gamma, n = 1, with_ties = FALSE)),\n    project_number = rownames(jh_sparse)\n  ) |&gt;\n  unnest(data) |&gt;\n  left_join(\n    jh_clean |&gt; select(project_number, project_title),\n    by = \"project_number\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(topic, project_title, gamma) |&gt;\n  mutate(gamma = round(gamma, 3)) |&gt;\n  arrange(topic, gamma) |&gt;\n  gt()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntopic\nproject_title\ngamma\n\n\n\n\n1\nValidation of peripheral CGRP signaling as a target for the treatment of pain in chronic pancreatitis\n0.991\n\n\n1\nDevelopment of MRGPRX1 positive allosteric modulators as non-addictive therapies for neuropathic pain\n0.994\n\n\n2\nDEVELOPMENT &amp; MALLEABILITY FROM CHILDHOOD TO ADULTHOOD\n0.993\n\n\n3\nData Center for Acute to Chronic Pain Biosignatures\n0.991\n\n\n3\nSocial Networks among Native American caregivers participating in an evidence-based and culturally informed intergenerational intervention\n0.993\n\n\n4\nHEALthy ORCHARD: Developing plans for a Baltimore site of the HEALthy BCD study\n0.989\n\n\n5\nSubchondral Bone Cavities in Osteoarthritis Pain\n0.985\n\n\n5\nImplementing and Evaluating the Impact of Novel Mobile Harm Reduction Services on Overdose Among Women who use Drugs: The SHOUT Study\n0.989\n\n\n6\nImproving Function and Reducing Opioid Use for Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain in Rural Communities Through Improved Access to Physical Therapy Using Telerehabilitation\n0.992\n\n\n6\nUNDERSTANDING THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN OPIOIDS AND SUICIDE THROUGH THE SOUTHWEST HUB\n0.993\n\n\n7\nEvaluating the Role of the Orexin System in Circadian Rhythms of Sleep and Stress in Persons on Medication-Assisted Treatments for Opioid Use Disorder\n0.993\n\n\n7\nEvaluating Suvorexant for Sleep Disturbance in Opioid Use Disorder\n0.993\n\n\n8\nValidation of a New Large-Pore Channel as a Novel Target for Neuropathic Pain\n0.987\n\n\n9\nThe Short and Long-Term Dynamics of Opioid/Stimulant Use: Mixed Methods to Inform Overdose Prevention and Treatment Related to Polysubstance Use\n0.992\n\n\n9\nSympathetic-mediated sensory neuron cluster firing as a novel therapeutic target for neuropathic pain\n0.995\n\n\n10\n7/24 Healthy Brain and Child Development National Consortium\n0.990\n\n\n11\nA sequenced-strategy for improving outcomes in patients with knee osteoarthritis pain\n0.989\n\n\n11\nA sequenced-strategy for improving outcomes in patients with knee osteoarthritis pain\n0.990\n\n\n11\nIncreasing Participant Diversity in a 'Sequenced-Strategy to Improve Outcomes in People with Knee Osteoarthritis Pain (SKOAP)\n0.991\n\n\n11\nMentorship of Junior Investigators on HEAL-SKOAP\n0.992\n\n\n11\nA sequenced-strategy for improving outcomes in patients with knee osteoarthritis pain\n0.994\n\n\n13\nDC Research Infrastructure Building &amp; Initiative to Reach, Engage, and Retain in MOUD Patients with OUD\n0.754\n\n\n13\nDC Research Infrastructure Building &amp; Initiative to Reach, Engage, and Retain in MOUD Patients with OUD\n0.754\n\n\n14\nQuantifying and Treating Myofascial Dysfunction in Post Stroke Shoulder Pain\n0.990\n\n\n14\nETHNIC DIFFERENCES IN ENDOGENOUS PAIN REGULATION: PET IMAGING OF OPIOID RECEPTORS\n0.993\n\n\n15\nSleep and Circadian Rhythm Phenotypes and Mechanisms Associated With Opioid Use Disorder Treatment Outcomes\n0.988\n\n\n16\nEffects of experimental sleep disruption and fragmentation on cerebral Mu-opioid receptor function, Mu-opioid receptor agonist analgesia, and abuse liability.\n0.991\n\n\n17\nHome-based transcutaneous electrical acustimulation for abdominal pain\n0.991"

First, there are 9,857 observations and 23 variables with no missing values. Also, the data has 6 factor variables and 17 numeric variables. It shows that most of the numeric variables are left skewed. The “sub_grade” and “addr_state” factor variables have 35 and 50 levels respectively. With so many unique values it’s very likely that some of the classes in each of those variables become overwhelmed by majority classes. While there are feature engineering steps that I can take such as consolidating infrequent classes or splitting up sub_grade into constituent parts, I’ll just allow the feature selection step to handle it. Finally, the “Class” factor variable (dependent variable) has two levels with the majority class – “good” – having 9,340 observations and the minority class – “bad” – having 517 observations.\nHere I’ll just look at the proportions of the Class variable.\n\nlending_club |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(y = Class)) +\n  geom_bar(aes(x = (..count..) / sum(..count..))) +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Proportion\",\n    y = NULL,\n    title = \"Frequency of loan outcome categories (Class)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere we see a sever class unbalance with only about 5% of loans having a “bad” outcome."

It’s also interesting to note that doing both – changing the probability threshold and upsampling – shows very little improvement over doing just one or the other. Below are some classification metrics for each model specification.\n\nconf_mats |&gt;\n  imap(\n    \\(x, y) summary(x) |&gt;\n      select(-.estimator) |&gt;\n      set_names(\"metric\", str_replace(y, \"_\", \" \") |&gt; str_to_title())\n  ) |&gt;\n  reduce(left_join, by = \"metric\") |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE) |&gt;\n  kable_styling(\"striped\")\n\n\n\n\nmetric\nBase Standard\nBase Optimal\nUpsample Standard\nUpsample Optimal\n\n\n\n\naccuracy\n0.9436105\n0.7083164\n0.6908722\n0.7452333\n\n\nkap\n0.0103118\n0.1137115\n0.1086066\n0.1316040\n\n\nsens\n0.0073529\n0.6470588\n0.6691176\n0.6176471\n\n\nspec\n0.9982825\n0.7118935\n0.6921426\n0.7526836\n\n\nppv\n0.2000000\n0.1159420\n0.1126238\n0.1272727\n\n\nnpv\n0.9451220\n0.9718640\n0.9728425\n0.9711911\n\n\nmcc\n0.0285977\n0.1775336\n0.1757144\n0.1909560\n\n\nj_index\n0.0056355\n0.3589523\n0.3612602\n0.3703306\n\n\nbal_accuracy\n0.5028177\n0.6794762\n0.6806301\n0.6851653\n\n\ndetection_prevalence\n0.0020284\n0.3079108\n0.3277890\n0.2677485\n\n\nprecision\n0.2000000\n0.1159420\n0.1126238\n0.1272727\n\n\nrecall\n0.0073529\n0.6470588\n0.6691176\n0.6176471\n\n\nf_meas\n0.0141844\n0.1966480\n0.1927966\n0.2110553\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first thing that one might notices from the above is how high the accuracy is for the base model. It’s important to remember, though, that when a data set is so unbalanced all a model has to do is predict the majority class all the time and it will have high accuracy. That model, though, has a very low sensitivity and high specificity. The high specificity, again, is due to the fact that the actual data has an overwhelming proportion of the majority class. Looking across at the metrics for the other models one sees drops in both accuracy and specificity, but much more significant increases in sensitivity from the base model. It’s also useful to note that other metrics like balanced accuracy, kappa, mcc, and f_measure also improve. This is further evidence of the effect that the imbalance in classes has on the base model."

Also, I chose this data set because it has some things in common with the data that I used in the aforementioned project that prompted this work such as having mixed data types (discrete and numeric) in the explanatory variables, a large enough number of observations for training (and tuning) and testing a model, and some problems with multicollinearity (or redundancy) in the explanatory variables.

Next I’ll look at the relationships among the numeric variables with a correlation plot.\n\nselect(housing, -sale_price) |&gt;\n  select_if(is.numeric) |&gt;\n  corrr::correlate(method = \"spearman\", use = \"pairwise.complete.obs\") |&gt;\n  corrr::rearrange(absolute = FALSE) |&gt;\n  corrr::shave() |&gt;\n  corrr::rplot(colors = c(\"red\", \"white\", \"blue\")) +\n  labs(title = \"Correlation Plot of Numeric Variables\", color = \"Correlation\") +\n  ml_eval_theme() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    panel.border = element_blank(),\n    axis.line = element_line()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere seems to be less of an interdependence problem among the numeric variables. To deal with this problem in both types of variables I’ll use the colino::step_mrmr() function step in my pre-processing recipe.\nNow I’ll move on to preparing the data for modeling."

This explanation from Christoph Molnar’s book Interpretable Machine Learning is a great primer on what SHAP values are and how they can help someone understand the effect of a given feature/variable on a prediction.\nWith that in mind, now that the models have been tuned, trained, and evaluated, I can generate SHAP values to understand what’s going on under the hood (kinda).

When considering all the observations collectively the feature value is ideally positively related with the SHAP value. Next I’ll look at partial dependence plots to show the effect that the gr_liv_area has on sale_price according to each model.\n\ngr_liv_area_pdp &lt;- final_wflows |&gt;\n  map2(c(\"XG Boost\", \"Linear Regression\"), plot_pdp, pred_var = gr_liv_area)\n\ngr_liv_area_pdp$xgb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngr_liv_area_pdp$lm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to both models the gr_liv_area variable positively effects the predicted sale price of a home in the training data, which seems consistent with general knowledge about home prices given that gr_liv_area is a measure of the above ground living area (more commonly known as “square footage”). It’s important to note, however, that, unlike the coefficient in a regression model, one should not make inferences from a partial dependency beyond the dimensions of the training data. A partial dependency plot is meant only to provide an overview on the broad relationship between an explanatory variable and the target variable.\nLastly, I can look at how each feature affects a particular observation with a contribution plot. I’ll consider the house observed in row 2049 of the training data set.\n\nobs_2409_contrib &lt;- shap |&gt;\n  map2(\n    c(\"XG Boost\", \"Linear Regression\"), \n    get_contributions, \n    rnum = 2049, \n    nfeat = 15 \n  )\n\n\nobs_2409_contrib$xgb$contrib_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nobs_2409_contrib$lm$contrib_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above XG Boost contribution plot shows that total_bsmt_sf had the largest positive effect on the predicted sale price of the sale in observation 2049 and having garage_finish_Unf (having an unfinished garage) had the largest negative effect. The Linear Regression contribution plot shows that gr_liv_area had the largest positive effect and neighborhood_Brookside had the largest negative effect on the predicted sale price. However, it’s interesting to note that garage_finish_Fin, the opposite of garage_finish_Unf, had a negative effect in the Linear Regression."

    "text": "Overview of the CE and CE PUMD\nFirst a little history…\nThe first Consumer Expenditure Survey happened in 1888 (https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cex/history.htm), it was first used to revise CPI weights in 1972-1973, and it has been collected on a monthly basis since 1979. For a little bit more detail on the history of the CE, check out the slide deck of a presentation delivered by Steve Henderson (former Chief of the Branch of Information and Analysis) and Adam Safir (current Division Chief of CE) called 130 Years of theConsumer Expenditure Surveys (CE): 1888 - 2018\nFrom the CE home page:\n\n“The Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CE) program provides data on expenditures, income, and demographic characteristics of consumers in the United States. The CE program provides these data in tables, LABSTAT database, news releases, reports, and public use microdata files.\n\n\nCE data are collected by the Census Bureau for BLS in two surveys, the Interview Survey for major and/or recurring items and the Diary Survey for more minor or frequently purchased items. CE data are primarily used to revise the relative importance of goods and services in the market basket of the Consumer Price Index. The CE is the only Federal household survey to provide information on the complete range of consumers’ expenditures and incomes. Here is an overview of the CE program and its methods.”\n\nSome important things to note are that expenditure data are collected through two different survey instruments (Diary and Interview), expenditure categories are organized hierarchichally, and data are stored across thousands of files to which the CE provides access through their website. Also, given the length of the program, it would be difficult to harmonize data across all those years and files, so there are some inconsistencies in the way data are stored, which cepumd seeks to address (more on this further down).\nPlease visit the following pages to learn more about the CE program overall and CE PUMD more specifically.\n\nCE homepage: (https://www.bls.gov/cex/)\nCE PUMD page: (https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd.htm)\nCE PUMD Getting Started Guide: https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd-getting-started-guide.htm\nCE Dictionary for Interview and Diary Surveys (XLSX download) (https://www.bls.gov/cex/pumd/ce_pumd_interview_diary_dictionary.xlsx)\nCE PUMD published tables: (https://www.bls.gov/cex/tables.htm)\nCE PUMD Handbook of Methods: https://www.bls.gov/opub/hom/cex/\nCE Frequently Asked Questions: https://www.bls.gov/cex/csxfaqs.htm"

    "text": "Cautions and recommendations\n\nEstimates produced using PUMD, which is topcoded by the CE and has some records suppressed to protect respondent confidentiality, will not match the published estimates released by the CE in most cases. The CE’s published estimates are based on confidential data that are not topcoded nor have records suppressed. You can learn more at CE Protection of Respondent Confidentiality.\nWhen calculating estimates for sub-samples or crosss-sections of data it is best to stick to the combinations of variables that the CE uses in it’s publication tables, e.g., income, geography, composition of CU, size of CU. This is because CE data are collected using a stratified, random sample (a.k.a., “representative sample”) and only analyses conducted using the stratification variables are statistically valid. Using other variables can be helpful to understand spending across different groups, but unweighted estimates are likely more useful for this. cepumd currently does not support unweighted estimates, but data for such an analysis can be prepared using ce_prepdata().\nQuantiles should only be generated using data from 1 survey instrument as the samples for the Interview and Diary are different.\nCheck the expenditure category in the appropriate HG file to ensure that it is the category for which you intend to generate an estimate.\nStore an HG object in the environment and call that directly in ce_prepdata()."

    "section": "Key cepumd functions",
    "text": "Key cepumd functions\n\nThe workhorse of cepumd is ce_prepdata(). It merges the household characteristics file (FMLI/-D) with the corresponding expenditure tabulation file (MTBI/EXPD) for a specified year, adjusts weights for months-in-scope and the number of collection quarters, adjusts some cost values by their periodicity factor (some cost categories are represented as annual figures and others as quarterly). With the recent update it only requires the first 3 arguments to function: the year, the survey type, and one or more valid UCCs. ce_prepdata() now creates all of the other necessary objects within the function if not provided.\nThere are two functions for wrangling hierarchical grouping data into more useable formats:\n\nce_hg() pulls the requested type of HG file (Interview, Diary, or Integrated) for a specified year.\nce_uccs() filters the HG file for the specified expenditure category and returns either a data frame with only that section of the HG file or the Universal Classification Codes (UCCs) that make up that expenditure category.\n\nThere are two functions that the user can use to calculate CE summary statistics:\n\nce_mean() calculates a mean expenditure, standard error of the mean, coefficient of variation, and an aggregate expenditure.\nce_quantiles() calculates weighted expenditure quantiles. It is important to note that calculating medians for integrated expenditures is not recommended because the calculation involves using weights from both the Diary and Survey instruments."

    "title": "Introduction to cepumd",
    "section": "Example workflows",
    "text": "Example workflows\nThe following are a few sample workflows that show how cepumd can be used. Before jumping into those I’ll first install and load the necessary pacakges and store some CEPUMD files. I’ll keep the path to those files in a variable called ce_data_dir.\n\npacman::p_load(knitr, readxl, tidyverse, cepumd)\n\n\nSimple workflow: Integrated pet expenditures\nThe following is an example of how someone might go about using cepumd to calculate a 2021 annual, weighted estimate of mean expenditures on pets for all of the U.S. using CE integrated data. This is just a quick and easy calculation.\n\ninteg21_hg &lt;- ce_hg(\n  2021,\n  integrated,\n  hg_zip_path = file.path(ce_data_dir, \"stubs.zip\")\n)\n\nce_prepdata(\n  2021,\n  integrated,\n  integ21_hg,\n  uccs = ce_uccs(integ21_hg, expenditure = \"Pets\", ucc_group = \"PETS\"),\n  dia_zp = file.path(ce_data_dir, \"diary21.zip\"),\n  int_zp = c(\n    file.path(ce_data_dir, \"intrvw20.zip\"),\n    file.path(ce_data_dir, \"intrvw21.zip\")\n  )\n) |&gt;\n  ce_mean() |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nagg_exp\nmean_exp\nse\ncv\n\n\n\n\n130886736176\n981.3035\n53.5767\n5.459748\n\n\n\n\n\nYup… that’s all it takes. I simply ran ce_hg to get the hierarchical grouping (stub) file for integrated expenditures for 2021; then ran ce_prepdata() with the year, the survey type, the stub file, uccs I needed, and the file paths to where I downloaded the data files; then I piped that directly into ce_mean(). An important thing to notice is that I provided two file paths to the int_zp argument. I did this because calculating integrated CE annual estimates actually requires 5 quarters of data from the Interview survey. Some of the data for calculating 2021 estimates is provided in the 2020 Interview data.This is one of the reasons it’s important to be familiar with CE methodology and how it changes over time when working with CE PUMD. Prior to 2020, file storing practices were different as stated in the Getting Started Guide Interview Survey section.\n\n\nSlightly more advanced workflow: Used Car & Truck Expenditures by Urbanicity\nIn this example I’ll calculate estimated annual expenditures on new and used cars by urbanicity also for 2021. Once the data are prepped with ce_data() I’ll just nest the data by urbanicity and run ce_means() and ce_quantiles() on the nested datasets. Since the overwhelming number of reports of vehicle purchases occur in the Interview survey, I’ll only use Interview data.\nFirst I’ll get the stub file and filter it for categories involving new or used cars.\n\nint21_hg &lt;- ce_hg(\n  2021,\n  interview,\n  hg_zip_path = file.path(ce_data_dir, \"stubs.zip\")\n)\n\nint21_hg |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(title, \"[C|c]ars\")) |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nlevel\ntitle\nucc\nsurvey\nfactor\n\n\n\n\n4\nCars and trucks, new\nNEWCARS\nG\n1\n\n\n5\nNew cars\n450110\nI\n1\n\n\n4\nCars and trucks, used\nUSEDCARS\nG\n1\n\n\n5\nUsed cars\n460110\nI\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nSo there’s one UCC for “New cars” and one for “Used cars”. I’ll use the code above to grab those UCCs and prepare my data.\n\ncar_data &lt;- ce_prepdata(\n  2021,\n  interview,\n  int21_hg,\n  uccs = int21_hg |&gt;\n    filter(str_detect(title, \"[C|c]ars\"), !is.na(as.numeric(ucc))) |&gt;\n    pull(ucc),\n  bls_urbn,  # &lt;------- this is the variable for urbanicity\n  int_zp = c(\n    file.path(ce_data_dir, \"intrvw20.zip\"),\n    file.path(ce_data_dir, \"intrvw21.zip\")\n  ),\n  recode_variables = TRUE,\n  dict_path = file.path(ce_data_dir, \"ce-data-dict.xlsx\")\n)\n\ncar_data |&gt;\n  group_nest(bls_urbn) |&gt;\n  mutate(ce_ann_means = map(data, ce_mean)) |&gt;\n  select(-data) |&gt;\n  unnest(ce_ann_means) |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nbls_urbn\nagg_exp\nmean_exp\nse\ncv\n\n\n\n\nUrban\n168458799558\n1341.7184\n106.2495\n7.918912\n\n\nRural\n4756065697\n591.5108\n155.0020\n26.204421\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting the annual, weighted estimate of the median (or another quantile) would be just as easy. Since I’m using interview data only here (it would be bad practice to try to calculate quantiles with integrated data), this would be a good example. I’ll calculate the first percentile and the median along with the 0.991 through 0.999 quantiles for the overall sample rather than breaking it down by urbanicity.\n\nce_quantiles(\n  car_data,\n  probs = c(0.01, 0.5, 0.95, seq(0.99, 0.999, by = 0.001))\n) |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nprobs\nquantile\n\n\n\n\n1.0%\n0\n\n\n50.0%\n0\n\n\n95.0%\n0\n\n\n99.0%\n8300\n\n\n99.1%\n10000\n\n\n99.2%\n12434\n\n\n99.3%\n15000\n\n\n99.4%\n17850\n\n\n99.5%\n20000\n\n\n99.6%\n22948\n\n\n99.7%\n26593\n\n\n99.8%\n30000\n\n\n99.9%\n40000\n\n\n\n\n\nAt least 95% of households in the Interview survey did not report expenditures on cars in 2021, which explains why the mean is so low.\n\n\nVery advanced workflow: Inflation adjusted food away from home expenditures by household size\nIn this last example I’m going to assume very little knowledge about the CE. I’d like to compare mean annual expenditures on food away from home between 2010 and 2020 by household size and I want to convert expenditures to 2023 dollars using the CPI. First I’d go to the CE PUMD Data Files page and download the files that I need for both years. I’ll also go to the CE PUMD Documentation page to download the hierarchical grouping files to get the UCCs for “Food away from home” and the CE Dictionary to find out what variable has data on the household size.\nWith all that done, now I want to look at the hierarchical grouping files for 2010 and 2020 for integrated data as they relate to “Food away from home”.\n\ninteg10_hg &lt;- ce_hg(\n  2010,\n  integrated,\n  hg_zip_path = file.path(ce_data_dir, \"stubs.zip\")\n)\n\ninteg20_hg &lt;- ce_hg(\n  2020,\n  integrated,\n  hg_zip_path = file.path(ce_data_dir, \"stubs.zip\")\n)\n\nFirst I’ll explore the titles of the hierarchical grouping files to see if any of them mention “food away”\n\ninteg10_hg |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(title), \"food away\")) |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nlevel\ntitle\nucc\nsurvey\nfactor\n\n\n\n\n3\nFood away from home\nFOODAWAY\nG\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I’ll do the same for 2020.\n\ninteg20_hg |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(title), \"food away\")) |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nlevel\ntitle\nucc\nsurvey\nfactor\n\n\n\n\n3\nFood away from home\nFOODAW\nG\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nHere I’ll take note of the title, which is the same in both years (“Food away from home”). I’ll use that to get the UCCs for both years.\n\nfood_away_uccs_10 &lt;- integ10_hg |&gt;\n  ce_uccs(expenditure = \"Food away from home\")\n\nfood_away_uccs_20 &lt;- integ20_hg |&gt;\n  ce_uccs(expenditure = \"Food away from home\")\n\nHere’s a quick look at the UCCs from 2010.\n\nfood_away_uccs_10\n\n [1] \"190111\" \"190112\" \"190113\" \"190114\" \"190211\" \"190212\" \"190213\" \"190214\"\n [9] \"190311\" \"190312\" \"190313\" \"190314\" \"190321\" \"190322\" \"190323\" \"190324\"\n[17] \"190901\" \"190902\" \"190903\" \"790430\" \"800700\"\n\n\nNow the 2020 UCCs.\n\nfood_away_uccs_10\n\n [1] \"190111\" \"190112\" \"190113\" \"190114\" \"190211\" \"190212\" \"190213\" \"190214\"\n [9] \"190311\" \"190312\" \"190313\" \"190314\" \"190321\" \"190322\" \"190323\" \"190324\"\n[17] \"190901\" \"190902\" \"190903\" \"790430\" \"800700\"\n\n\nThe vectors of UCCs look identical, but I’ll keep both just to be cautious.\nNext I’ll turn to finding the variable for household size in the CE data dictionary. It’s important to remember that the dictionary is stored as an “XLSX” file. I’ll use functions from the readxl package to work with the dictionary.\n\nexcel_sheets(file.path(ce_data_dir, \"ce-data-dict.xlsx\"))\n\n[1] \"Cover\"     \"Variables\" \"Codes \"   \n\n\nNow I’ll see what variables contain anything about the number of household members. To do that I’ll have to load the sheet from the dictionary containing the variable definitions. I also want to filter the variable data to only the FMLI where the “Last year” column is missing, i.e., the variable definition is still in use.\n\nce_variables &lt;- read_excel(\n  file.path(ce_data_dir, \"ce-data-dict.xlsx\"),\n  sheet = \"Variables\"\n)\n\nce_variables |&gt;\n  filter(\n    str_detect(File, \"FMLI\"),\n    str_detect(\n      tolower(`Variable description`), \"number of members\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey\nFile\nVariable Name\nVariable description\nFormula\nFlag name\nSection number\nSection description\nSection part\nFirst year\nFirst Quarter\nLast quarter\nLast year\nComment\n\n\n\n\nINTERVIEW\nFMLI\nAS_COMP5\nNumber of members under age 2 in CU\nCOUNT (AGE &lt; 2)\nAS_C_MP5\nNA\nCU characteristics, income, weights, and summary level expenditures.\nNA\n1984\n1\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nINTERVIEW\nFMLI\nAS_COMP5\nNumber of members under age 2 in CU\nNA\nAS_C_MP5\nNA\nCU characteristics, income, weights, and summary level expenditures.\nNA\n1980\n1\n4\n1981\nNA\n\n\nINTERVIEW\nFMLI\nFAM_SIZE\nNumber of Members in CU\nNA\nFAM__IZE\nNA\nCU characteristics, income, weights, and summary level expenditures.\nNA\n1984\n1\nNA\nNA\nNA\n\n\nINTERVIEW\nFMLI\nFAM_SIZE\nNumber of Members in CU\nNA\nFAM__IZE\nNA\nCU characteristics, income, weights, and summary level expenditures.\nNA\n1980\n1\n4\n1981\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like FAM_SIZE is the variable I want. I can see that this variable was used from 1980 through 1981 then was dropped and re-introduced in 1984 and has been in use since. So it looks like it’s available for my 2 years of interest. Next I’ll check whether the FAM_SIZE variable has any value codes associated with it. I’ll have to pull in the “Codes” sheet. (Check your spelling here.)\n\nce_codes &lt;- read_excel(\n  file.path(ce_data_dir, \"ce-data-dict.xlsx\"),\n  sheet = \"Codes \"\n)\n\nce_codes |&gt;\n  filter(File %in% \"FMLI\", Variable %in% \"FAM_SIZE\") |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey\nFile\nVariable\nCode value\nCode description\nFirst year\nFirst quarter\nLast year\nLast quarter\nComment\n…11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like FAM_SIZE is not a coded variable (no observations in the “Codes” sheet), so it must be numeric. With all that, I’m ready to prepare my data. I’ll start by preparing the 2010 data and getting a summary of the FAM_SIZE variable since it is a continuous variable.\n\nfood_away_data_10 &lt;- ce_prepdata(\n  2010,\n  integrated,\n  integ10_hg,\n  food_away_uccs_10,\n  dia_zp = file.path(ce_data_dir, \"diary10.zip\"),\n  int_zp = file.path(ce_data_dir, \"intrvw10.zip\"),\n  fam_size\n)\n\nsummary(food_away_data_10$fam_size)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.

Max. \n  1.000   1.000   2.000   2.666   4.000  14.000 \n\n\nSince some households have as many as 14 people, I’ll create a FAM_SIZE label with any number greater than 4 taking on the value “5+”. Next, I’ll prepare the 2020 data and rowbind it with the 2010 data as well as create the “fam_size_label” variable.

There are a lot of 0-value reported expenditures, though, in the CE on food away from home. Unfortunately, I can’t perform an analysis using only respondents that did have expenditures in this category, i.e., dropping the 0’s, because whether someone had an expenditure on food away from home is not one of the variables used for generating the survey weights. In other words, the analysis can be done, but it would not be statistically valid and I definitely wouldn’t be able to infer from it. This is just another cautionary note to anyone using this package who might use it in a way that does not follow statistically sound practices. Please visit the CE’s website and read the CE PUMD Getting Started Guide for more information.\n\n\nDealing with inconsistent code definitions\nIn this workflow I’m going to calculate estimated mean utilities expenditures for 2015 using integrated data by CU composition using the FAM_TYPE variable. In this case I’m going to start by looking at the codes for that variable to show how one might run into an inconsistency in code definitions across survey instruments. First I’m going to set up a sub-directory in my temporary directory and store what I’ll need to get started.\nFirst, I’ll look at code descriptions for the “FAM_TYPE” variable in the dictionary and I’m going to focus on the code values of 3, 5, and 7. I still have the ce_codes object in memory, so I’ll just use that.\n\nce_codes |&gt;\n  janitor::clean_names() |&gt;\n  filter(\n    variable %in% \"FAM_TYPE\",\n  first_year &lt;= 2015,\n  (last_year &gt;= 2015 | is.na(last_year)),\n  code_value %in% c(\"3\", \"5\", \"7\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  select(survey, code_value, code_description) |&gt;\n  arrange(code_value, survey) |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsurvey\ncode_value\ncode_description\n\n\n\n\nDIARY\n3\nMarried couple, own children only, oldest child &gt; 6, &lt; 18\n\n\nINTERVIEW\n3\nMarried Couple, own children only oldest child &gt;= 6, &lt;= 17\n\n\nDIARY\n5\nAll other Married couple families\n\n\nINTERVIEW\n5\nAll other Husband and wife families\n\n\nDIARY\n7\nOne parent, female, own children, at least one age &lt; 18\n\n\nINTERVIEW\n7\nOne parent, female, own children, at least one age &lt; 18\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code descriptions for these 3 code values are different across instruments. To resolve this I’m going to create a table containing only codes from the Interview survey.\n\nfam_type_codes &lt;- ce_codes |&gt;\n  janitor::clean_names() |&gt;\n  filter(\n    variable %in% \"FAM_TYPE\",\n    first_year &lt;= 2015,\n    (last_year &gt;= 2015 | is.na(last_year))\n  )\n\ncodes2keep &lt;- fam_type_codes |&gt;\n  filter(survey %in% \"INTERVIEW\") |&gt;\n  select(code_value, code_description)\n\nfam_type_codes &lt;- fam_type_codes |&gt;\n  select(-code_description) |&gt;\n  left_join(codes2keep, by = \"code_value\") |&gt;\n  relocate(code_description, .after = code_value)\n\nfam_type_codes |&gt;\n  filter(code_value %in% c(\"3\", \"5\", \"7\")) |&gt;\n  select(survey, code_value, code_description) |&gt;\n  arrange(code_value, survey) |&gt;\n  kable(booktabs = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsurvey\ncode_value\ncode_description\n\n\n\n\nDIARY\n3\nMarried Couple, own children only oldest child &gt;= 6, &lt;= 17\n\n\nINTERVIEW\n3\nMarried Couple, own children only oldest child &gt;= 6, &lt;= 17\n\n\nDIARY\n5\nAll other Husband and wife families\n\n\nINTERVIEW\n5\nAll other Husband and wife families\n\n\nDIARY\n7\nOne parent, female, own children, at least one age &lt; 18\n\n\nINTERVIEW\n7\nOne parent, female, own children, at least one age &lt; 18\n\n\n\n\n\nNow the codes are consistent across survey instruments and I can use this codebook in my call to ce_prepdata() using the “own_codebook” argument. Then I’ll pass that to ce_mean() per usual.\nNext I’ll get some information about how utilities expenditures are organized using the stub file.\n\ninteg15_hg &lt;- ce_hg(\n  2015,\n  integrated,\n  hg_zip_path = file.path(ce_data_dir, \"stubs.zip\")\n)\n\ninteg15_hg |&gt;\n  filter(str_detect(str_to_lower(title), \"utilities\")) |&gt;\n  kable(bookmarks = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\nlevel\ntitle\nucc\nsurvey\nfactor\n\n\n\n\n3\nUtilities, fuels, and public services\nUTILS\nG\n1\n\n\n\n\n\nThe expenditure category associated with utilities is “Utilities, fuels, and public services”.
