<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Medicare Readmission Rate Analysis</h1>
<h4 class="author"><em>Arcenis Rojas</em></h4>

</div>


<div id="introduction" class="section level1">
<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This analysis will consider the differences in Medicare readmission rates among hospitals across the U.S. Data from the project will come from the Data.Medicare.gove portal, which is an open data repository. Analyses will consist of various statistical tests and visualizations with a focus on the differences in distribution of readmission rates by hospital characteristics such as hospital type and ownership. More specifically, the focus will be on excess readmissions, which are determined by the ratio of their “predicted” readmissions within a 30-day period to their “expected” readmissions in the same period. “Expected” readmissions are determined by the mean number of readmissions for a given type of hospital stay for hospitals within a peer group.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-retrieval-exploration-and-cleaning" class="section level1">
<h1>Data retrieval, exploration, and cleaning</h1>
<p>Data.Medicare.gov data can be downloaded as flat files or through the Socrata Open Data API (SODA). The two files needed for this analysis are the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) data and the General Hospital Information (GHI) data.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Read in the readmission data via SODA using the RSocrata package
# hrrp_data &lt;- read.socrata(&quot;https://data.medicare.gov/resource/kac9-a9fp.json&quot;)

# Read in the general hospital information data
# ghi_data &lt;- read.socrata(&quot;https://data.medicare.gov/resource/rbry-mqwu.json&quot;)

# Store the data locally to avoid having to ping the API repeatedly
# write_rds(hrrp_data, &quot;hrrp_data.rds&quot;)
# write_rds(ghi_data, &quot;ghi_data.rds&quot;)

# Using the data that were saved above as pulling from the API will take longer.

<p>In the readmission data we are primarily interested in the expected and predicted readmission rates and the readmission ratio, so we’ll keep those along with the provider ID and measure ID, which correspond to the different types of medical procedures for which readmission rates are computed. We’ll also change the data types as necessary.</p>
<p>The GHI data has a large number of footnote variables that each corresponds to a national comparison measure. We’ll keep the national comparison measures, but not the footnotes, and also keep the provider ID and other variables that will be used for the comparison. We’ll also clean up the variable names and some of the data value labels and change the data types as necessary. We’ll also only keep acute care hospitals that are not in Maryland given that most other types of hospitals and all hospitals in Maryland are exempt and, therefore, do not have readmission rate data.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ll merge the datasets on “provider_id.”</p>

<h1>Visualizing the distribution of readmission ratios</h1>
<p>First we’ll look at the distribution of readmission ratios across the different conditions.</p>
<p><img src="hrrp-anova_files/figure-html/dist_viz-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It appears that the distributions of readmission ratios for the different conditions are fairly similar to one another except for hip/knee replacements and coronary artery bypass grafting, which have much wider distributions. Below we can look at the distribution of readmission ratios by condition and overall rating.</p>
<p><img src="hrrp-anova_files/figure-html/dist_viz_by_feature-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It appears that distributions are also different across the different levels of overall rating. In the next section we’ll poerform analyses of variance in readmission ratios by condition and overall rating.</p>

<h1>Analyses of variance (ANOVA)</h1>
<p>The first step in performing a statistical analysis is understanding the variance across groups. Below is a table showing the counts and mean readmission ratios by overall rating and condition.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Group the merged data by hospital overall rating and condition
ghi_hrrp %&gt;%
  group_by(overall_rating, measure_id) %&gt;%
  
  # Generate a count and a mean for each group
  summarise(
    count = n(),
    avg_rr = mean(readm_ratio, na.rm = T)
  ) %&gt;%
  
  # Convert it to a dataframe so that the entire table prints to the console
  data.frame %&gt;%
  
  # Print the table to the console
  print</code></pre>

<p>It appears that the ratio of predicted readmissions to expected readmissions generally decreases as the overall rating increase. The next step is to determine whether the variance is homogenous across all groups, however, having such a small number of observations with a missing overall rating could skew this measure, so we’ll exclude these observations from the remainder of the analysis. To determine whether the variance is homogenous we’ll use Levene’s test.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Drop observations with missing overall rating data
ghi_hrrp &lt;- ghi_hrrp %&gt;%
  filter(!is.na(overall_rating))</code></pre>
<p>First we’ll look at the results of Levene’s tests for the overall rating variable and the measure_id variables separately.</p>
<pre><code>## Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)

<p>Separately, both have statistically significant variances across their categorical groups. Now we’ll consider the homogeneity of variance including both variables and their interactions.</p>
<pre><code>## Levene&#39;s Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)
##          Df F value    Pr(&gt;F)    
## group    29  66.036 &lt; 2.2e-16 ***

<p>Given that the p-value on Levene’s test is less than .05, we can reject the null hypothesis that the variance is homogenous across the 30 cross-sections of our data. Now we can go ahead and perform a two-way analysis of variance of readmission ratios controlling for overall rating, the condition, and their interaction.</p>
<p>First, we’ll determine whether the interaction is significant.</p>

<p>Given that the F-test of the interaction model against the model without an interaction has a p-value of less than .05, we can conclude that the interaction has a significant effect on the variance across all the groups. But, because the variances across the groups are heterogeneous, we must run an ANOVA for an unbalanced sample, or a “type III” ANOVA. However, before runing that analysis it might be good to look at the normality of the residuals from the ANOVA including the interaction term to be thorough even though moderate deviations of normality wouldn’t affect an ANOVA too badly. We’ll run a Komogorov-Smirnov (KS) test because a Shapiro-Wilk test (the usual test) in R can only handle 5000 observations where we have 13930.</p>
<pre><code>##

<p>Both the KS test and the QQ plot indicate that there is non-normality in our residuals. However, a histogram shows that the residuals are fairly normally distributed. The QQ plot shows the normality is violated mainly at the upper extreme of the readmission ratio, or in the right tail of the distribution. We can see, for example, that the distribution is right-skewed in the histogram. For expediency we’ll continue with the analysis knowing that there is a only a slight risk of false negatives in the ANOVA rather than removing outliers or transforming the data.</p>

<p>The ANOVA adjusting for an unbalanced sample indicates that overall rating, the condition, and their interaction all affect the readmission ratio. We’ll now look at an interaction plot for this analysis.</p>
<p><img src="hrrp-anova_files/figure-html/int_plot-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>This plot confirms our previous conclusion that overall rating is related to the readmission ratio, however, the interaction only appears statistically significant for hip/knee hospitalizations between hospitals with overall ratings of 1 and 2 and across all groups for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). To check this we can run a Tukey Honest Significant Differences analysis. Because there would be over 200 rows in this analysis, we’ll look at a table of the ratio of differences that are significant at the 95% confidence level.</p>
<pre><code>## $overall_rating
##   pct_signif
## 1       100%
## 
## $measure_id
##   pct_signif
## 1      26.7%
## 
## $interaction
##   pct_signif
## 1      63.2%</code></pre>
<p>100% of the pairwise differences of the categories of overall ratings are statistically significant, 26.7% of the pairwise differences of the categories of overall ratings are statistically significant, and 63.2% of the pairwise differences of the categories of overall ratings are statistically significant. This suggests that the condition may not be important in determining the variance in readmission ratios, but the overall rating and its interaction with the condition are important.</p>
