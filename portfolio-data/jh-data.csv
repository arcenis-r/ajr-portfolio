1RF1NS134549-01,Validation of a New Large-Pore Channel as a Novel Target for Neuropathic Pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Discovery and Validation of Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Treatment of Pain,NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,"QIU, ZHAOZHU (contact); GUAN, YUN","Baltimore, MD",2023,"Activation of immune cells (microglia) in the central nervous system and neuroinflammation have emerged as key drivers of neuropathic pain. These processes can be triggered by release of ATP, the compound that provides energy to many biochemical reactions. The source and mechanism of ATP release are poorly understood but could be targets of novel treatment approaches for neuropathic pain. This project will use genetic, pharmacological, and electrophysiological approaches to determine whether a large pore channel called Swell 1 that spans the cell membrane is the source of ATP release and resulting neuropathic pain and thus could be a treatment target."

1UG3AR083838-01,Improving Function and Reducing Opioid Use for Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain in Rural Communities Through Improved Access to Physical Therapy Using Telerehabilitation,Clinical Research in Pain Management,Prevention and Management of Chronic Pain in Rural Populations,NIAMS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,"SKOLASKY, RICHARD L (contact); MCLAUGHLIN, KEVIN","Baltimore, MD",2023,"Physical therapy is the recommended treatment for patients with low back pain and is a cost-effective method for improving pain and reducing disability. However, only 7-13% of patients receive physical therapy services. Access is particularly limited in rural communities due to lack of provider availability, transportation, and missed work time. These factors have contributed to more low back pain-related disability and opioid use among rural populations. Physical therapy delivered through telemedicine may improve access by reducing patient-reported barriers. This randomized clinical trial will compare an innovative, patient-centered telemedicine version of physical therapy to a currently used psychologically based educational approach for rural patients with chronic low back pain. The research will match individual patients to a treatment approach based on their psychosocial risk of poor outcomes."

In addition to impairments in the ability to move, persistent shoulder pain contributes to depression, and often reduces quality of life. Although the cause of post-stroke shoulder pain is complex and not completely understood, it is thought to arise in part to damage of muscles and surrounding connective tissues (myofascial tissues) in the shoulder. This project will use advanced medical imaging techniques to create biomarkers of that can reliably identify myofascial tissues. The research will then test the ability of these biomarkers to monitor, and ultimately predict treatment responses in patients with post-stroke shoulder pain in the context of a randomized controlled clinical trial."

More than 40% of IBS patients regularly use opioid narcotics. An alternative treatment for IBS that has been shown to be an effective pain management strategy is electroacupuncture. However its drawbacks include infrequent administration, unclear mechanistic understanding, and lack of methodology optimization. This study will use a noninvasive method of transcutaneous electrical acustimulation (TEA) by replacing needles with surface electrodes and testing acupoints that target peripheral nerves. Based on prior mechanistic and clinical studies, two stimulation parameters and effective acupoints will be tested. In the UG3 phase, the TEA device and a cell phone app will be optimized for use in IBS abdominal pain, and an acute clinical study will determine the best stimulation locations and parameters. During the UH3 phase, an early feasibility clinical study will be performed in 160 IBS patients in treating abdominal pain. Participants will self-administer the therapy at home/work and will be randomized across four treatment groups to determine the therapeutic potential of the TEA system."

1R01DK123138-01,Validation of peripheral CGRP signaling as a target for the treatment of pain in chronic pancreatitis,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Discovery and Validation of Novel Targets for Safe and Effective Treatment of Pain,NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,"PASRICHA, PANKAJ J","Baltimore, MD",2019,"Chronic pancreatitis (CP) and the debilitating pain associated with it remains a common and challenging clinical syndrome that is difficult to treat effectively. Using rodent models of CP, preliminary studies have found that nerve growth factor (NGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFb) appear to be acting by the common effector, calcitonin-gene related peptide (CGRP), to induce pain in CP. CGRP is known to mediate pain as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, specifically as a potent vasodilator involved in migraine. This project will test the hypothesis that peripheral CGRP is a major mediator of peripheral nociceptive sensitization in CP, and that peripherally restricted anti-CGRP treatment could provide an efficient and sufficient approach for the treatment of pain in pancreatitis"

1UG3NS115718-01,Development of MRGPRX1 positive allosteric modulators as non-addictive therapies for neuropathic pain,Preclinical and Translational Research in Pain Management,Development and Optimization of Non-Addictive Therapies to Treat Pain,NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,"TSUKAMOTO, TAKASHI","Baltimore, NC",2019,"Although opioid-based analgesics have been proven effective in reducing the intensity of pain for many neuropathic pain conditions, their clinical utility is grossly limited due to the substantial risks involved in such therapy, including nausea, constipation, physical dependence, tolerance, and respiratory depression. Cumulative evidence suggests that human Mas-related G protein-coupled receptor X1 (MRGPRX1) is a promising target for pain with limited side effects due to its restricted expression in nociceptors within the peripheral nervous system; however, direct activation of MRGPRX1 at peripheral terminals is expected to induce itch side effects, limiting the therapeutic utility of orthosteric MRGPRX1 agonists. This finding led to the exploration of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of MRGPRX1 to potentiate the effects of the endogenous agonists at the central terminals of sensory neurons without activating peripheral MRGPRX1. An intrathecal injection of a prototype MRGPRX1 PAM, ML382, effectively attenuated evoked, persistent, and spontaneous pain without causing itch side effects. The goal of this study is to develop a CNS-penetrant small-molecule MRGPRX1 PAM that can be given orally to treat neuropathic pain conditions."

1U01HL150835-01,Evaluating the Role of the Orexin System in Circadian Rhythms of Sleep and Stress in Persons on Medication-Assisted Treatments for Opioid Use Disorder,New Strategies to Prevent and Treat Opioid Addiction,Sleep Dysfunction as a Core Feature of Opioid Use Disorder and Recovery,NHLBI,Johns Hopkins University,"HUHN, ANDREW S (contact); FINAN, PATRICK","Baltimore, MD",2019,"For individuals with moderate to severe opioid use disorder (OUD), medication-assisted treatments (MATs) such as oral methadone and extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) are the gold standard in initiating and maintaining long-term recovery. Still, many patients struggle with persistent sleep disturbance and stress reactivity in the early stages of recovery, which drive relapse behaviors. This proposal constitutes a novel mechanistic approach to understanding the role of the orexin system in sleep disturbance and circadian rhythms of stress in OUD patients who are maintained on MATs and are early in recovery. This study will determine whether the FDA-approved sleep medication suvorexant (SUVO) improves sleep continuity and decreases diurnal measures of stress, and whether improvement of sleep/stress processes translates to improved OUD treatment outcomes. Its findings will fill critical gaps in our understanding of the role of the orexin system in sleep disturbance and circadian rhythms of stress that impact OUD recovery."

Sleep disturbances are prevalent, treatable, and increasingly recognized as risk factors for both chronic pain and OUD. Sleep disruption impairs endogenous pain inhibition, linked to analgesic efficacy and rewarding properties of mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists. It is not known, however, whether sleep disturbance causally alters mechanisms that contribute to OUD risk. Sleep continuity disruption (SCD) and/or sleep fragmentation (SF) may alter cerebral MOR availability, and these forms of sleep disruption may increase OUD risk. This study aims to 1) evaluate whether experimental SCD and/or SF alter resting or pain-evoked MOR binding potential (BP) in brain regions associated with pain inhibition; 2) examine whether SCD and/or SF alters the analgesic response; and 3) determine whether MOR BP in brain regions of interest are associated with analgesia and abuse liability."

The participants of the FSP and CC original prevention trial were a population (n = 798) of urban, predominately African-American young adults, who began first grade in the fall of 1993 in nine elementary schools in predominantly low- to lower-middle-income Baltimore areas. The central purpose of the proposed study is to extend through ages 31-35 an examination of normal and pathogenic development and the impact of these two universal first-grade preventive interventions on the distal targets mentioned above. We will continue to study the role of phenotypic and genetic factors (and their interactions) as well as the impact of the interventions on the development and course of substance use/abuse/dependence, psychiatric symptoms/disorders, antisocial behavior/disorder and high-risk sexual behavior through young adulthood. The knowledge accrued over the course of the proposed assessments should serve to inform the nature, targets and timing of our future preventive intervention efforts."

However, due to technical limitations, spontaneous activity in sensory neurons in vivo has not been well studied. Using in vivo imaging in genetically-modified mice, preliminary findings identified spontaneously-firing clusters of neurons formed within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) after traumatic nerve injury that exhibits increased spontaneous pain behaviors. Furthermore, preliminary evidence has been collected that cluster firing may be related to abnormal sympathetic sprouting in the sensory ganglia. This project will test the hypothesis that cluster firing is triggered by abnormal sympathetic inputs to sensory neurons, and that it underpins spontaneous paroxysmal pain in neuropathic pain models. Findings from this project will identify potential novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropathic pain."

Suvorexant (SUVO; Belsomra®) is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that is FDA-approved for insomnia, with low addiction liability, that improves sleep continuity with a single dose, has an extremely safe and mild side-effect profile, has clear interactions with the opioid system, and has not yet been evaluated in OUD patients. The hypothesis is that SUVO will improve total sleep time during withdrawal, have no addiction liability, and be more efficacious than trazodone, a common OUD-associated insomnia medication. Primary outcomes will be objective sleep measures and addiction liability. Secondary measures will include objective, biological, and self-report measures of opioid withdrawal severity, treatment retention, craving, and stress. Results will advance the treatment of OUD, the understanding of sleep and opioids, and the use of SUVO in clinical populations."

Ethnic differences in opioid neurotransmitters suggest that these systems function less efficiently among AAs and may account for differences in pain and analgesic responses. The overwhelming majority of clinically used opioids elicit their effects through activation of the mu-opioid receptor, making it a relevant target for investigation. We propose to examine ethnic differences in the supraspinal endogenous opioid system using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mu-opioid receptors employing the mu-selective agonist [11C]carfentanil. Healthy AAs and sex-, age-, SES-matched NHW participants will undergo one baseline (non-pain) and one capsaicin-induced pain PET session using [11C]carfentanil. The current proposal will measure µ-opioid binding potential and examine its role in ethnic group differences in pain sensitivity."
